By employing geospatial analysis techniques, we seek to provide insights into the evolving nature of the conflict, its geographical distribution, and potential implications for conflict resolution and humanitarian efforts.\n\n## 1.0 Introduction\n\nMyanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been embroiled in a complex and multifaceted conflict since its independence in 1948. The current phase of the conflict, which this study focuses on, began with the military coup on February 1, 2021. This coup abruptly ended a decade of quasi-democratic rule and plunged the country into a new era of political instability and armed conflict.\n\n### 1.1 Timeline of Conflict\n\nThe conflict in Myanmar is part of a long history of political instability and ethnic tensions. To understand the current situation, it's crucial to consider the **historical precedence**:\n\n* 1948: Myanmar gains independence from British rule.\n* 1962: General Ne Win leads a military coup, establishing a one-party state.\n* 1988: Nationwide pro-democracy protests (8888 Uprising) are violently suppressed by the military.\n* 1990: The National League for Democracy (NLD) wins a landslide victory in elections, but the military refuses to hand over power.\n* 2011: The military junta is officially dissolved, leading to a period of quasi-democratic rule.\n* 2015: The NLD wins a majority in the first openly contested election in 25 years.\n\n**Recent Events:**\n\nFebruary 1, 2021: The Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw/junta) seizes power in a coup d'état, detaining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior members of the ruling NLD party.\n\nFebruary 2021 onwards: Nationwide protests erupt against military rule, known as the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).\n\nApril 2021: The National Unity Government (NUG), a parallel government formed by ousted lawmakers and ethnic leaders, declares a \"people's defensive war\" against the military junta.\n\n2021-2024: Ongoing armed conflict between the military, ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), and newly formed People's Defence Forces (PDFs).\n\n### 1.2 Key Actors\n\nThe conflict in Myanmar involves multiple actors with diverse interests:\n\n* **Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces**: The main actor representing the military junta.\n* **National Unity Government (NUG)**: The parallel government formed by ousted lawmakers and ethnic leaders.\n* **Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs)**: The EAOs are made of disjointed groups representing ethnic minorities, some of which have been in conflict with the central government for decades.\n* **People's Defence Forces (PDFs)**: A coalition of civilian resistance groups formed in response to the military coup.\n\n### 1.3 Regional Dynamics\n\nMyanmar's conflict landscape is complex and multifaceted, with regional dynamics playing a crucial role:\n\n* **Sagaing Region**: Traditional hotspot of resistance against the military junta, with intense fighting between the military and local PDFs.\n* **Rakhine State**: Historically a site of conflict involving the Arakan Army (EAO) and issues related to the Rohingya minority.\n* **Shan State**: Complex dynamics involving multiple EAOs and ongoing conflicts over territory and resources.\n* **Yangon Region**: The country's largest city and former capital, a focal point for urban resistance and protests.\n\n## 2.0 Data Collection\n\n### 2.1 Armed Conflict Data\n\nFor this assignment, armed conflict data of Myanmar between January 2021 - June 2024 from [Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/), an independent, impartial, international non-profit organization collecting data on violent conflict and protest in all countries and territories in the world, was used.\n\n### 2.2 GIS Data\n\nRelevant [Geospatial data](http://geonode.themimu.info/layers/?limit=100&offset=0) was gathered from [Myanmar Information Management Unit

Divisions\n\nBefore we conducting any analysis, we need to familiarize ourselves with the entire map of Myanmar. Myanmar is divided into several administrative divisions, including states, regions, districts, and townships. We will visualize these administrative divisions using the `tmap` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\ntmap mode set to plotting\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolorblind_friendly_palette <- brewer.pal(8, \"Set2\")\n\nmyanmar_map <- tm_shape(adm1) +\n  tm_polygons(\"ST\", \n              title = \"States and Regions\",\n              palette = colorblind_friendly_palette,\n              border.col = \"white\",\n              border.alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_shape(adm0) +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 2) +\n  tm_graticules(labels.inside.frame = FALSE,\n                labels.rot = c(0, 90)) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Administrative Divisions of Myanmar\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.outside.position = \"right\",\n            frame = FALSE)\n\n# tmap_save(myanmar_map, filename = \"myanmar_admin_divisions.png\", width = 8, height = 10)\nmyanmar_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 4.0 Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the Conflict Landscape\n\n### 4.1 Overall Landscape of Conflict Events\n\n**Spatial Point Distribution**\n\nThe point map of conflict events in Myanmar, while rudimentary, is crucial for understanding the spatial distribution of the conflict. At a glance, we can observe **regional hotspots**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoint_map <- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = adm1, fill = \"white\", color = \"gray\") +\n  geom_sf(data = acled_sf, aes(color = event_type), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.6) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Conflict Events in Myanmar\",\n       color = \"Event Type\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5, alpha = 1, shape = 15))) +\n  theme(legend.key.size = unit(1, \"cm\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"))\n\npoint_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nKey Observations: \n\n1. There appears to be a much higher concentration of events in the **Central and Northern regions**\n2. Coastal areas and southern regions show fewer events, which suggests the conflict is more intense in the interior of the country.\n\n**Event Type Distribution**\n\nAnother basic plot, but important to our discussion, is the distribution of event types. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevent_type_plot <- acled_sf %>%\n  count(event_type) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(event_type, n), y = n, fill = event_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = -0.2, size = 3) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Event Types\",\n       x = \"Event Type\", y = \"Number of Events\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.3)))\n\nevent_type_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nKey Observations:\n\n1. Battles appear to be the most common type of event, indicating a high level of direct armed confrontation.\n2. Violence against civilians is also prevalent, highlighting the humanitarian impact of the conflict.\n3. Protests and riots suggest significant civil unrest component to the overall conflict landscape.\n4. The presence of strategic developments indicates that non-violent events also play a role in shaping the conflict dynamics.\n\nAt this stage, looking at numbers alone is insufficient and will not guarantee a comprehensive picture of the conflict landscape. We need to delve deeper into the data to uncover more nuanced insights.\n\n**Top Actors**\n\nNo conflict discussion can be complete without framing the key actors involved. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop_actors <- acled_sf %>%\n  gather(key = \"actor_type\", value = \"actor\", actor1, actor2) %>%\n  count(actor) %>%\n  top_n(5, n) %>%\n  mutate(actor = fct_reorder(actor, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = actor, y = n, fill = actor)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n, y = n), hjust = -0.2) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.25))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 5 Actors by Number of Events\",\n       x = \"Actor\", y = \"Number of Events\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\ntop_actors\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nKey Observations:\n\n1. Military-Centric Conflict: The **Myanmar Armed Forces are overwhelmingly involved** in the highest nunmber of events, more than all other actors combined. \n2. Humanitarian Crisis: The high involvement of civilians implies a severe humanitarian impact, potentially including human rights violations, displacement, and civilian casualties.\n3. Asymmetric Conflict: The vast disparity between military events and other groups is a situation where the state's armed forces are engaged against multiple, smaller opposition groups and civilian resistance.\n4. Potential for Escalation: The high involvement of civilians and protestors alongside military actions **may indicate a volatile solution** with potential for further escalation. Whether this holds true, we need to delve deeper into the data.\n\n**Bonus: Network Analysis of Top Actors**\n\nIf it wasn't apparent that the Myanmar Armed Forces is the central antagonist in the conflict, a network analysis of the top actors will make it abundantly clear. We want to explicitly show their deep involvement in the conflict landscape.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nactor_network <- acled_sf %>%\n  dplyr::select(actor1, actor2) %>%\n  filter(actor1 != actor2) %>%\n  group_by(actor1, actor2) %>%\n  summarise(weight = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  filter(weight > 30) \n\ngraph <- graph_from_data_frame(actor_network, directed = FALSE)\ntop_actors <- names(sort(degree(graph), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10])\ngraph <- induced_subgraph(graph, top_actors)\n\ncomm <- cluster_louvain(graph)\nV(graph)$community <- membership(comm)\nV(graph)$degree <- degree(graph)\n\nlayout <- layout_with_kk(graph)\n\nnetwork_data <- as.data.frame(layout)\nnames(network_data) <- c(\"x\", \"y\")\nnetwork_data$name <- V(graph)$name\nnetwork_data$community <- V(graph)$community\nnetwork_data$degree <- V(graph)$degree\n\nset.seed(123)\nnetwork_data$x <- network_data$x + runif(nrow(network_data), -0.05, 0.05)\nnetwork_data$y <- network_data$y + runif(nrow(network_data), -0.05, 0.05)\n\nedge_data <- as_edgelist(graph) %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  rename(from = V1, to = V2) %>%\n  left_join(actor_network, by = c(\"from\" = \"actor1\", \"to\" = \"actor2\")) %>%\n  left_join(network_data, by = c(\"from\" = \"name\")) %>%\n  rename(x = x, y = y) %>%\n  left_join(network_data, by = c(\"to\" = \"name\"), suffix = c(\"\", \"_end\")) %>%\n  rename(xend = x_end, yend = y_end)\n\nnum_communities <- length(unique(network_data$community))\ncolor_palette <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8, \"Dark2\"))(num_communities)\n\nnetwork_plot <- ggplot() +\n  geom_segment(data = edge_data, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend, linewidth = weight),\n               alpha = 0.3, color = \"lightgray\", na.rm = TRUE) +\n  geom_point(data = network_data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = as.factor(community), size = degree)) +\n  geom_text(data = network_data, aes(x = x, y = y, label = name), check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, vjust = 1.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_palette) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2, 10)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Network of Top Actors in Conflicts\",\n       subtitle = \"Showing connections with weight > 30\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n         plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1, 1), \"cm\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\") +\n  expand_limits(x = c(min(network_data$x) - 0.4, max(network_data$x) + 0.4), \n                y = c(min(network_data$y) - 0.4, max(network_data$y) + 0.4))\n\nggsave(\"network_plot.png\", network_plot, width = 12, height = 10, dpi = 300)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Network Plot](network_plot.png)\n\nKey Observations:\n\n1. Central Node - Myanmar Armed Forces: Being the largest node in the graph, the military forces has connections to almost all other actors. Unsurprisingly, it is the most connected and influential actor in the conflict. This is unsurprising for several reasons:\n    * The national military is engaged in conflicts with multiple groups across the country\n    * It has the resources and reach to be involved in most conflict events\n2. Civilian (Myanmar) Node: The second largest node represents civilians. Civilians are frequently targets or involved in conflict events.\n\n**Section Recap**\n\n1.

This pattern indicates a potential shift in conflict dynamics rather than de-escalation.\n    * Research Question: How has the nature of the conflict changed over time, and what factors are contributing to the sustained high fatality rates despite decreasing event frequency?\n3. **Central Role of Myanmar Armed Forces**: The miltary is overwhelmingly involved in conflict events. Their dominance suggests an asymmetric conflict where state forces are engaged against multiple, smaller opposition groups and civilian resistance.\n4. **Regional Variations in Conflict Characteristics**: The Southern front on a whole is relatively less contested, though Yangon shows a unique pattern. \n\n## 5.0 First Order Spatial-Temporal Patterns Analysis: A Closer Look at the Myanmar Conflict Landscape\n\n### 5.1 Quarterly Kernel Density Estimation\n\n**Methodology**\n\n* Temporal Trends: Quarterly KDE maps will be generated to visualize the spatial distribution of conflict events over time.\n* Duplicate Coordinates: There are duplicates in the Myanmar conflict data.

L-Function: The L-function measures the number of points within a given distance of any arbitrary point. It's useful for detecting patterns at multiple scales.\n3.

It seems like Shan suffers from **decently large fluctuations** in conflict intensity.\n2. Spatial Distribution: Conflict hotspots are scattered across Shan, the Northern and Southern areas being persistently affected.\n3. Complex Spatial Pattern: Shan is a curious case, as the conflict patterns appears more dispersed compared to other regions, possibly due to its larger size and diverse ethnic composition.\n\n#### 6.2.5 Summary: Central/Northern Regions\n\nThrough our Second Order Analysis, the four hotspots we identified generally conform to similar trends:\n\n1. **Spatial Clustering**: All regions exhibit significant clustering of conflict events at multiple scales, as evidenced by the G and L functions.\n2. **Temporal Evolution**: The intensity of conflicts in these regions generally decreases over time, with some fluctuations in the later quarters of 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe spatial distribution of conflict events in Sagaing, Magway, Mandalay, and Shan regions, which form part of Myanmar's **Dry Zone**, is not uniform. Instead, conflict events are concentrated in specific areas, particularly along borders and urban centers, reflecting the strategic significance of these regions. \n\nThe Dry Zone, situated in the central part of Myanmar, is an agriculturally vital area, especially for rice production, despite its relatively arid climate. Control over these regions is crucial for economic and political power, as the ability to control or disrupt food supplies can have widespread consequences. Thus, these regions provide both tactical and strategic advantages, making them hotspots for prolonged conflict.\n\n### 6.3 Southern Region Hotspots\n\nWe have identified the distinctive hotspot in the Southern region as **Yangon**.

Sagaing and Yangon are experiencing fundamentally different conflict dynamics.\n\n**Summary: Fatality Analysis**\n\n1. Regional Variation: Sagaing and Yangon exhibit different types and intensities of conflict. The importance then falls on understanding the underlying causes and dynamics, and utilizing region-specific approaches in conflict resolution and peacekeeping efforts.\n2. Conflict Evolution: Temporal analysis suggests that while the overall conflict may be showing signs of de-escalation, it remains volatile and unpredictable.\n3. Civilian Impact: The high proportion of fatalities from violence against civilians in Yangon underscores severe humanitarian implications of the conflict, particularly in urban areas.\n\n## 9.0 Conclusion\n\n### 9.1 Overall Insights\n\nThe analysis of the Myanmar conflict from January 2021 to June 2024 has revealed several key insights:\n\n1. Spatial Heterogeneity: The EDA and spatial analyses consistently showed that the conflict in Myanmar is not uniformly distributed. Regions like Sagaing, Magway, Mandalay, Shan, and Yangon emerged as major hotspots, while other areas experienced relatively less intense conflict.\n  * Border Proximity: Conflict hotspots were often concentrated around the borders, suggesting strategic importance and potential cross-border influences.\n2. Temporal Evolution: The first-order and second-order analyses revealed a dynamic conflict landscape. We observed an initial escalation phase in 2021, followed by peaks in intensity during 2022-2023, and hints of potential de-escalation in some areas by 2024. However, this trend varied significantly across regions.\n3. Conflict Intensity and Event Types: Our analysis showed that different regions experienced varying types and intensities of conflict events. For instance, Sagaing saw a high number of battles, while Yangon experienced more incidents of violence against civilians.\n4. Regional Variations: The conflict exhibited distinct characteristics in different regions, likely influenced by factors such as ethnic composition, strategic importance, and historical context.\n\n### 9.2 Personal Takeaways\n\nThis exercise provided an invaluable opportunity to gain both a macroscopic and focused view of the ongoing conflict in Myanmar.\n\nThe combination of various analytical techniques allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the conflict's complexity, moving beyond headline news to grasp nuanced realities on the ground.\n\nThe power of data analysis in conflict studies became evident, as plotting visualizations demonstrate how quantitative methods can complement qualitative understanding to provide a more complete picture.\n\nI'm particularly proud of the scatter plot analysis, temporal trend visualizations and network analysis, which provided unique insights into the conflict dynamics. \n\nThe integration of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data added a crucial geographical context to enhance the interpretability of our findings.\n\n## References\n\n1. *Myanmar’s Coup Shakes Up Its Ethnic Conflicts*.
