The city's educational infrastructure plays a crucial role in shaping the future of its residents. In this analysis, we will explore the spatial distribution of educational facilities across Jakarta to understand the accessibility and equity of educational resources.\n\n### 1.2 Scope and Objectives\n\nOur project encompasses three primary areas of investigation.\n\n1.  **Spatial Points Patterns Analysis of Distribution of Schools**:\n\n-   Examination of school distribution patterns across Jakarta\n-   Identification of areas with significant clustering or dispersion\n-   Assessment of spatial relationships between different types of educational facilities\n\n2.  **LISA and Hot-spot, Cold-spot Analysis**\n\n-   Identification of Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) clusters\n-   Detection of hot-spots and cold-spots of schools\n-   Investigation of spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of schools\n\n3.  **Geographically Weighted Regression Modeling**\n\n-   Exploration of relationships between education levels and school availability and accessibility\n-   Assessment of spatial variations across different districts\n-   Investigation of socioeconomic factors influencing school distribution patterns\n\nThis research aims to provide insights into the spatial dynamics of educational facilities in Jakarta and inform policy decisions to enhance educational equity and access. By combining spatial analysis techniques with statistical modeling, we can uncover hidden patterns and relationships that are crucial for effective urban planning and resource allocation.\n\n### 1.3 Indonesia's Education System\n\nIndonesia's education system is structured into several stages:\n\n**Primary Education**\n\n-   **Elementary School (SD)**: Compulsory education for children aged 7-12 years\n-   **Special Elementary School (SDLB)**: Schools for children with special needs\n\n**Secondary Education**\n\n-   **Junior High School (SMP)**: Follows elementary school and is for students aged 13-15 years\n-   **Special Junior High School (SMPLB)**: Schools for students with special needs\n\n**High School Education**\n\n-   **Senior High School (SMA)**: Follows junior high school and is for students aged 16-18 years\n-   **Vocational High School (SMK)**: Focuses on vocational training and skills development\n-   **Special Senior High School (SMLB)**: Schools for students with special needs\n\n**Special Education**\n\n-   **Special Education (SLB)**: Schools for children with disabilities\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, we have combined the types of schools into four main types. Note that Junior High Schools may also be interchangeably referred to as Secondary Schools. Senior High Schools may also be referred to as High Schools.\n\nWe decided to add SMLB into High Schools instead of Special Education Schools because it is more similar to SMA and SMK in terms of educational level.\n\n1.  **Elementary Schools**: Includes SD and SDLB\n2.  **Junior High Schools**: Includes SMP and SMPLB\n3.  **Senior High Schools**: Includes SMA, SMK, and SMLB\n4.  **Special Education Schools**: Includes SLB\n\n### 1.4 Analysis Methodology\n\nThe spatial points patterns analysis follows a multi-scale approach:\n\n1.  **Provincial Level Analysis**:\n\n-   Initial exploration of school distribution patterns across Jakarta\n-   Global clustering analysis\n-   Population density correlation\n\n2.  **City Level Analysis**:\n\n-   Local clustering patterns\n-   School type interactions\n-   Public-private school dynamics\n\n3.  **Statistical Methods**:\n\n-   Kernel Density Estimation\n-   Nearest Neighbour Analysis\n-   Quadrat Analysis\n-   Cross-K Function Analysis\n-   Ripley's K Function and L Function Analysis\n\n### 1.4 Datasets\n\nThis study utilizes three primary datasets.\n\n1.  **Indonesia Schools Dataset**:\n\n-   Source: Kaggle - [Indonesia Schools Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marchotridyo/indonesia-school-dataset-with-province-data)\n-   This datasets contains information about schools across Indonesia, including location, type, and educational stage.\n\n2.  **Indonesia Administrative Boundaries**:\n\n-   Source: [Indonesia - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geoboundaries-admin-boundaries-for-indonesia?)\n-   We selected the ADM2 level boundaries for provincial level analysis.\n\n3.  **Subdistrict Data**:\n\n-   Source: [Indonesia Geospasial](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/download-shapefile-shp-batas-desa.html)\n-   This dataset provides detailed subdistrict boundaries for Jakarta, and contains population aggregated by subdistrict.\n\n## 2.0 Data Preprocessing\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, knitr, viridis, patchwork, gridExtra, kableExtra, sfdep, tmap, tmaptools, patchwork, scales, spdep, ggrepel, spatstat)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nindo_schools_kaggle <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/complete_data.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 215371 Columns: 11\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (6): province_name, city_name, district_name, school_name, stage, status\ndbl (5): lat, long, province_area, total_population, total_education_age_pop...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter loading the data for Indonesia schools, we will filter and preprocess the data to focus on Jakarta schools and clean the administrative boundaries data.

This allowed for more detailed visualizations and controls for each level. The statistical tests would be grouped together in their respective tabs.\n\nHowever, there were still limitations to this design.\n\n-   Statistical tests competed for limited space\n-   Limited ability to focus on specific analyses\n-   Navigation between province and city views seemed confusing\n-   Difficult to compare analyses across different levels\n\n#### 8.4.3 Final Three-Tab Design\n\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n| Spatial Points Patterns Analysis                 |\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe three tab design would feature the following tabs:\n\n1.  Provincial Overview\n2.  City Analysis\n3.  Statistical Tests\n\nThis design solved the issue of space limitations and allowed for more detailed visualizations and controls. The statistical tests would have their own tab, and this seemed more efficient.\n\nIf users were interested to know about what goes on behind the scenes, they could navigate to the statistical tests tab. Naturally, the statistics tab were more important to stakeholders rather than regular users.\n\nEach visualization panel contains:\n\n-   Title bar with blue background\n-   Interactive visualizations\n-   Caption and/or descriptions\n\nThis design meets the following requirements\n\n-   Separation of concerns across tabs\n-   Changes in each tab would not affect the others\n-   Improved visual hierarchy\n-   Equal emphasis on all analysis types\n-   Dedicated control sidebar present in all views (albeit with some minor differences)\n\n### 8.5 Application Features\n\n#### 8.4.1 Provincial Analysis\n\n![](./screenshots/province_overview.png) \n\n**Purpose**\n\nThe Provincial Overview tab provides macro-level insights into school distribution patterns across Jakarta.\n\n**Components and Interactions**\n\nLeft Sidebar Controls:\n\n![](./screenshots/controls_province.png)\n\n1.

The three-tabbed design is implemented through a persistent sidebar menu that maintains context across different views.\n\n#### 9.1.1. Layout Components\n\n-   Headers: Dual-line title with hierarchical typography\n-   Sidebar: Fixed width (300px) navigation and control panel\n-   Body: Responsive grid-based content area\n-   Boxes: Consistent 6-column width containers for visualizations\n\n### 9.2 Color Palette\n\n**Primary Colors**: \n\n- Brand Blue: #3c8dbc (Links, buttons, active states) \n- Dark Background: #2c3b41 (Sidebar) \n- White: #ffffff (Text, icons) \n- Muted: #4f5962 (Borders, separators)\n\n**Accent Colors**: \n- Success/Active: #367fa9 \n- Border Highlight: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\n\nThese colors were chosen to maintain a professional, modern look while ensuring readability and accessibility.\n\n### 9.3. Interactivity\n\n### 9.3.1 `shinyWidgets` components\n\n**Pretty Checkbox Groups**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprettyCheckboxGroup(\n  inputId = \"schoolLevels\",\n  label = \"School Levels:\",\n  choices = c(\"Elementary\", \"Junior High\", \"Senior High\", \"Special Education\"),\n  status = \"primary\",\n  animation = \"smooth\",\n  icon = icon(\"check\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe checkboxes are styled wih the `shinyWidgets` package to provide enhanced visual feedback, clear active states and improved touch targets.\n\n**Picker Inputs**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npickerInput(\n  inputId = \"citySelect\",\n  label = \"Select City:\",\n  choices = cities,\n  options = list(\n    style = \"btn-primary\",\n    size = 5,\n    `live-search` = TRUE\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `pickerInput` widget is used to create a dropdown with search functionality. This allows users to quickly find and select the desired city.\n\n### 9.3.2 `shinyBS` tooltips\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbsTooltip(\n  \"provincialBandwidth\",\n  \"Adjust the smoothing parameter for density estimation\",\n  placement = \"right\",\n  options = list(container = \"body\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen adjusting the KDE bandwidth slider, we provide a tooltip to explain the purpose of this control. This improves accessibility while maintaining clear instruction delivery. The positioning of the tooltip is also non-intrusive to the main content.\n\n### 9.4 Visual Container System\n\n#### 9.4.1 Box Components\n\nEach visualization is contained within a standardized box.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbox(width = 6,\n    plotOutput(\"visualization\"),\n    title = \"Main Title\",\n    subtitle = \"Descriptive subtitle\",\n    status = \"primary\",\n    solidHeader = TRUE,\n    footer = div(\n      class = \"text-muted\",\n      style = \"font-style: italic; padding: 10px;\",\n      \"Contextual information\"\n    )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe box component includes:\n\n-   Consistent padding\n-   Clear visual hierarchy\n-   Contextual footers\n-   Solid headers for emphasis\n\n#### 9.4.2 Sidebar Sections\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n.sidebar-section {\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);\n  border-radius: 4px;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe sidebar controls are different depending on which tab the user is on. The sidebar section is deliberately styled according to the above to provide a clear visual separation from the main content area.\n\n## 10.0 Shiny: Storyboarding\n\n### 10.1 User Personas\n\n**Education Policymaker**\n\n-   User Background: Maria, Director of Education Planning\n-   Needs: Understand resource distribution, identify underserved areas\n-   Goals: Make data-driven decisions about new school locations\n\n**Urban Planner**\n\n-   User Background: Ahmad, City Development Analyst\n-   Needs: Analyze school accessibility relative to population density\n-   Goals: Integrate education facilities into urban development plans\n\n**School Administrator**\n\n-   User Background: James, Private School Network Manager\n-   Needs: Understand market gaps and opportunities\n-   Goals: Strategic planning for new educational facilities\n\n### 10.2 User Journey Map\n\n#### 10.2.1 Initial Engagement\n\n1.  Entry Point: Provincial Overview Tab\n2.  First Impressions: School Distribution Chart\n3.  Progression: KDE Map Exploration\n4.  Context Building: Population Density Comparison\n\n#### 10.2.2 Learning Flow\n\n**Provincial Level Understanding**\n\nStep 1: Overall Distribution - Views total school counts across cities - Notices East Jakarta has highest concentration - Questions: \"Why this distribution?\"\n\nStep 2: Density Patterns - Explores KDE map - Adjusts bandwidth to see clustering - Insight: Schools cluster in urban centers\n\nStep 3: Educational Level Analysis - Switches to level distribution - Compares proportions across cities - Discovery: Elementary schools dominate\n\n**City Level Deep Dive**\n\nStep 1: City Selection - Chooses area of interest - Focuses on local patterns - Compares with provincial context\n\nStep 2: Public-Private Balance - Examines ownership ratios - Notes variations by district - Identifies service gaps\n\nStep 3: Spatial Analysis - Studies nearest neighbor results - Understands clustering patterns - Forms hypotheses about distribution\n\n**Statistical Validation**\n\nStep 1: Pattern Confirmation - Reviews quadrat analysis - Validates clustering observations - Builds confidence in findings\n\nStep 2: Cross-Analysis - Examines K-functions - Understands spatial relationships - Confirms or adjusts hypotheses\n\n### 10.3 Key Learning Moments\n\n#### 10.3.1 Distribution Insights\n\n**User Thought Process**\n\n-   \"I see East Jakarta has the most schools, but...\" -\\>\n-   \"The density map shows concentrations in unexpected areas\" -\\>\n-   \"Population density explains some patterns, but not all\" -\\>\n-   \"There might be historical or socioeconomic factors at play\"\n\n#### 10.3.2 Accessibility Analysis\n\n**User Realization Path**\n\n-   \"High school distribution seems more clustered than elementary\" -\\>\n-   \"This makes sense given transportation capabilities of older students\" -\\>\n-   \"But some areas might still be underserved\" -\\>\n-   \"Need to compare with population age demographics\"\n\n#### 10.3.3 Policy Implications\n\n**Decision-Making Process**\n\n-   \"Statistical tests confirm non-random distribution\" -\\>\n-   \"Some areas show significant clustering\" -\\>\n-   \"Need to balance between concentration and accessibility\" -\\>\n-   \"Can identify priority areas for new facilities\"\n\n### 10.4 Knowledge Building\n\n#### 10.4.1 Core Insights\n\n1.  **Spatial Distribution Understanding**\n\n-   Pattern recognition\n-   Clustering identification\n-   Access gap discovery\n\n2.  **Educational Resource Balance**\n\n-   Public-private dynamics\n-   Level distribution patterns\n-   Service coverage analysis\n\n3.  **Statistical Validation**\n\n-   Pattern confirmation\n-   Significance understanding\n-   Evidence-based conclusions\n\n#### 10.4.2 Applied Learning\n\nObservation → Analysis → Validation → Action Example: Notices clustering → Examines local factors → Confirms statistical significance → Identifies development opportunities\n\nThis proposed storyboard emphasizes user discovery and learning, guiding stakeholders through meaningful analysis while maintaining flexibility for different analytical approaches. Each interaction builds upon previous knowledge, creating a comprehensive understanding of Jakarta's educational landscape.\n\n## References\n\n1.  Claude AI. (n.d.).
